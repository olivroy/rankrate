\title{Estimate the MLE of a Mallows-Binomial distribution using the GreedyLocal method}
\usage{
GreedyLocal(rankings, ratings, M)
}
\arguments{
\item{rankings}{A matrix of rankings, potentially with attribute "assignments" to signify separate reviewer assignments. One ranking per row.}

\item{ratings}{A matrix of ratings, one row per judge and one column per object.}

\item{M}{Numeric specifying maximum (=worst quality) integer rating.}
}
\value{
List with elements pi0 (estimated consensus ranking MLE),  p (estimated object quality parameter MLE), theta (estimated scale parameter MLE), and numnodes (number of nodes traversed during algorithm, a measure of computational complexity).
}
\description{
This function estimates the MLE of a Mallows-Binomial distribution using the GreedyLocal method, which is identical to the Greedy method but includes an automatic and targeted post-hoc local search.

\examples{
rankings <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,2,1,NA,NA),byrow=TRUE,nrow=2)
ratings <- matrix(c(2,1,2,3,1,2,2,5),byrow=TRUE,nrow=2)
GreedyLocal(rankings=rankings,ratings=ratings,M=5)
