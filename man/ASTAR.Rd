\title{Calculate the exact MLE of a Mallows-Binomial distribution using an A* algorithm}
\usage{
ASTAR(rankings, ratings, M, keep_nodes = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{rankings}{A matrix of rankings, potentially with attribute "assignments" to signify separate reviewer assignments. One ranking per row.}

\item{ratings}{A matrix of ratings, one row per judge and one column per object.}

\item{M}{Numeric specifying maximum (=worst quality) integer rating.}

\item{keep_nodes}{Boolean specifying if function should retain a list of nodes traversed during A* tree search. Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
List with elements pi0 (consensus ranking MLE),  p (object quality parameter MLE), theta (scale parameter MLE), and numnodes (number of nodes traversed during algorithm, a measure of computational complexity). If keep_nodes=TRUE, a list of traversed nodes is also included.
}
\description{
This function estimates the exact MLE of a Mallows-Binomial distribution using an A* tree search algorithm proposed in Pearce and Erosheva (2022). Algorithm may be very slow when number of objects exceeds 15, but is often still tractable for larger J when consensus is strong.
